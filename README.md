### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello world, 
I'm a media professional for the last 15 years having worked in the analog (broadcast TV) and digital (OTT) sides. Since the lockdown in 2020, I have turned quite curious towards data science and am keen to learn and apply cutting-edge analytical concepts to the media business. 

To derive stronger consumer insights from data, I've familiarised myself with Machine Learning concepts & tinker regularly with R. It is my understanding that data analysts have access to extremely powerful tools and are limited by their own creativity. Looking forward to collaborate with other like-minded data enthusiasts to put my content domain expertise to the test.
