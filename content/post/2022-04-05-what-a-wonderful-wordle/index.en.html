<p>Who ever thought that a bunch of black and green boxes would bring out the <a href = "https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/logophile">logophile</a> in us all? With friends and family groups sharing their progress, I find this to be an entertaining mind-puzzle to kickstart the day.</p>
<p>And I was not alone in fascination for 5 letter words. Wordle has tickled the fascination of many in the data science community. I foun <a href = "https://rviews.rstudio.com/2022/02/21/wordle-data-analysis/">Arthur Holtz’s lucid breakdown of the Wordle dataset</a> quite interesting. Of course, there is 3B1B’s incredibly detailed videos on applying Information Theory to this 6-by-5 grid. (<a href = "https://youtu.be/v68zYyaEmEA">original video</a> as well as the <a href = https://youtu.be/fRed0Xmc2Wg>follow-up errata</a>)</p>
<p>Others have simulated the wordle game (<a href= "https://datascienceplus.com/how-i-selected-my-starting-word-for-wordle-using-simulations-and-r/">like here</a>) or even solved it for you (<a href = "https://blog.ephorie.de/wordle-solve-wordle-with-r">like this blog</a>). I’ve read at least (<a href = "https://theconversation.com/want-to-master-wordle-heres-the-best-strategy-for-your-first-guess-176325">one blog post</a>) that has an academic take on the matter.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the reader, none of the above will be attempted by me. My inspiration comes from <a href = "https://towardsdatascience.com/wordle-a-frequency-analysis-approach-9989c3d7be5f">Gerry Chng’s Frequency Analysis Approach</a> where I’ve tried to understand the most commonly occuring letters in the official word list by position by considering a ranking mechanism</p>
<div id="what-is-a-wordle" class="section level2">
<h2>What is a wordle?</h2>
<p>The game rules are fairly simple:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You need to guess a 5-letter word. One new word is given every day</li>
<li>You are given 6 guesses</li>
<li>After every guess, each square is coded by a color
<ul>
<li>GREY: chosen letter is not in the word</li>
<li>YELLOW: chosen letter is in the word by wrong position</li>
<li>GREEN: chosen letter is in the word and in the correct position</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Repetition of letters is allowed</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it!</p>
<p>In my opinion, one of the reasons for the game going viral is the way the results are shared. You’ve possibly seen something like this floating around:

<p>…And if your family too has been bitten hard by the Wordle bug, then you would be familiar with group messages like this!</p>

<h2>Frequency analysis</h2>
<p><a href="https://rviews.rstudio.com/2022/02/21/wordle-data-analysis/">Arthur Hotlz’s blog</a> is a good place to start for extracting and loading the Official Wordle list. After parsing and cleaning the data, here’s all the words broken down into a single rectangular dataframe <code>position_word_list</code> with each column signifying the position</p>
<pre><code>##    p1 p2 p3 p4 p5
## 1   C  I  G  A  R
## 2   R  E  B  U  T
## 3   S  I  S  S  Y
## 4   H  U  M  P  H
## 5   A  W  A  K  E
## 6   B  L  U  S  H
## 7   F  O  C  A  L
## 8   E  V  A  D  E
## 9   N  A  V  A  L
## 10  S  E  R  V  E</code></pre>
<p>Now onto some frequency analysis. Here’s a breakdown of all the letters in the wordle list sorted by number of occurrences.</p>
