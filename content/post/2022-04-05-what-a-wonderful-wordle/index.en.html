<p>Who ever thought that a bunch of black and green boxes would bring out the <a href = "https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/logophile">logophile</a> in us all? With friends and family groups sharing their progress, I find this to be an entertaining mind-puzzle to kickstart the day.</p>
<p>And I was not alone in fascination for 5 letter words. Wordle has tickled the fascination of many in the data science community. I found Arthur Holtz’s lucid breakdown of the Wordle dataset <a href = "https://rviews.rstudio.com/2022/02/21/wordle-data-analysis/">post</a> quite interesting. Of course, there is 3B1B’s incredibly detailed videos on applying Information Theory to this 6-by-5 grid. (<a href = "https://youtu.be/v68zYyaEmEA">original video</a> as well as the <a href = https://youtu.be/fRed0Xmc2Wg>follow-up errata</a>)</p>
<p>Others have simulated the wordle game (<a href= "https://datascienceplus.com/how-i-selected-my-starting-word-for-wordle-using-simulations-and-r/">like here</a>) or even solved it for you (<a href = "https://blog.ephorie.de/wordle-solve-wordle-with-r">like this blog</a>)</p>
<p>Fortunately for the reader, none of the above will be attempted in this post. Today we try and figure out what makes the best opening word</p>
<div id="what-is-a-wordle" class="section level1">
<h1>What is a wordle?</h1>
<p>This is an example of the glimpse function</p>
<pre><code>## Rows: 2,309
## Columns: 1
## $ word &lt;chr&gt; &quot;CIGAR&quot;, &quot;REBUT&quot;, &quot;SISSY&quot;, &quot;HUMPH&quot;, &quot;AWAKE&quot;, &quot;BLUSH&quot;, &quot;FOCAL&quot;, &quot;E~</code></pre>
