<h2>Tidy Tuesday, Week 19 (2022)</h2>
<p>“Learn by practice!” is a maxim that every coder/analyst agrees upon. One of the admirable initiatives by the R/ RStudio community is <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">Tidy Tuesday</a> - every week a new dataset is released for enthusiasts to dig into. A few days back, an interesting dataset caught my eye - <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-05-10/readme.md">NYT’s Bestsellers List</a> from 1930 to 2021. This one was particularly unique as it mirrored a lot of projects that I’ve been doing on the OTT side as well. So I cracked my knuckles and jumped right in!</p>

<p>Quick EDA tells us that there the number of books in the #1 spot each year during the 50s have been increasing while the number of weeks they’ve spent on the NYT list has been decreasing. 2020-21 is excluded as I’m breaking up the period into decades for easy analysis</p>

  mutate(decade = factor(10*year %/% 10)) %&gt;%

<p>This is a fantastic starting point. Intuitively, this makes a lot of sense. There’s far more competition for the #1 spot in the last 20 years which is driving down the longevity. Compare the 50’s to the 2010’s and the trend is hard to miss. This table is only for the books that made it to the #1 position. But how about the rest of the other books? A visual representation draws the same conclusion more elegantly.</p>
<p>Hat-tip to a few outstanding viz I came across while researching the NYT theme. <a href="https://rud.is/b/2016/03/16/supreme-annotations/">Bob Rudis’ Supreme Annotations</a> and <a href="https://rsangole.netlify.app/posts/2021-04-13-30-day-chart-challenge/2021-04-13-30-day-chart-challenge">Rahul Sangole’s Visualizing Correlations</a></p>

<p>Paints the same story in a much more simpler manner, don’t it? Now lets look at seasonality - is there any trend as far as the launch month is concerned? For the sake of analysis, I’ve truncated the analysis period to 2010 onwards to keep it more relevant and exlcude irrelvant historical data.</p>
