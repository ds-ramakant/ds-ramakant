# Day 8: Titanic Dataset


Progress till date:

-   Download titanic dataset and assign to `train` & `test`
-   Rearranging the data
-   EDA (including plots and finding survival rate using `.groupby()`)
-   Modelling
  -  Data preparation
    -  one-hot encoding the `Sex`, `Pclass` & `Embarked` columns
    -  appending these to the numerical columns
    -  normalising the data
    -  splitting between `train` into `X_train`, `y_train`, `X_test`, `y_test`
  - Applying KNN algo
    -  finding the right K based on accuracy. (best at K = 7)
    -  Calculating the accuracy based on `test`
    
To do today:
- Perform Decision Tree classification

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import zipfile


#importing the zipfile already saved in the other folder. 
zf = zipfile.ZipFile("../2022-10-12-day-6-of-50daysofkaggle/titanic.zip")
train = pd.read_csv(zf.open("train.csv"))
test = pd.read_csv(zf.open("test.csv"))

#Selecting only the numerical columns
num_col = train.select_dtypes(include=np.number).columns.tolist()

#deslecting passenger ID and 'Survived' 
del num_col[0:2] #.remove() can remove only 1 item. so for more than 1, use for loop 
select_col = num_col

#remaining columns
str_col= ["Sex", "Embarked", "Survived"]
str_col

#Adding more elements into a list using `extend` and not `append`
select_col.extend(str_col)
select_col

train_eda= train[train.columns.intersection(select_col)]
train_eda
```
