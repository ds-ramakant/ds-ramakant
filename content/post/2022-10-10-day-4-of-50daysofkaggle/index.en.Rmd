# Day 4: The Titanic Dataset

Previously I managed to download the titanic zip file using the kaggle api and extract two datasets `train` and `test` .

```{python}
import requests
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import kaggle 
import zipfile 

kaggle.api.authenticate()

kaggle.api.competition_download_files("titanic", path = ".")

zf = zipfile.ZipFile("titanic.zip")
train = pd.read_csv(zf.open("train.csv"))
test = pd.read_csv(zf.open("test.csv"))
```

## Rearranging `train` dataset

Lets see what we have here

```{python}
train.head
```

```{python}
train.info()
```

`PassengerID` is the unique identifier for each row while `Survived` is the column to be predicted. Finding only the numeric columns and dropping the above two (ref - [this link](https://thispointer.com/python-how-to-remove-multiple-elements-from-list/#:~:text=Remove%20Multiple%20elements%20from%20list%20by%20index%20range%20using%20del,can%20use%20del%20keyword%20i.e.&text=It%20will%20delete%20the%20elements,from%20index1%20to%20index2%20%E2%80%93%201.))

```{python}
num_col = train.select_dtypes(include=np.number).columns.tolist()

del num_col[0:2] #.remove() can remove only 1 item. so for more than 1, use for loop 
select_col = num_col
```

Among the string columns, only `Sex` and `Embarked` are relevant for our analysis. [Ref - selecting columns by intersection](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40636514/selecting-columns-by-list-and-columns-are-subset-of-list)

```{python}
str_col= ["Sex", "Embarked", "Survived"]
str_col


select_col.extend(str_col)
select_col

train_eda= train[train.columns.intersection(select_col)]

train_eda.info()
```

## EDA

```{python}
import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

sns.catplot(data = train_eda, x = "Age", y = "Fare", hue = "Survived")
            
plt.show()
```

Clearly the older folks in

```{python}
plt.clf()
sns.boxplot(data = train_eda, y = "Age", x = "Pclass", hue = "Survived")
plt.show()
```

Below graph shows us that among the survivors, there were a lot more women than men survived the disaster.

```{python}
plt.clf()
plot = sns.FacetGrid(data = train_eda, col = "Survived", hue = "Sex", col_wrap = 2)
plot.map(sns.scatterplot, "Age", "Fare")
plot.axes[-1].legend()
plt.show()
```

There also seems to be a clearer skew towards Class 1 (richer) compared to Class 3 (poorer)

```{python}
plt.clf()
plot = sns.FacetGrid(data = train_eda, col = "Survived", hue = "Pclass", col_wrap = 2)
plot.map(sns.scatterplot, "Age", "Fare")
plot.axes[-1].legend()
plt.show()
```

```{python}

plt.clf()
plot = sns.FacetGrid(data = train_eda, col = "Survived", hue = "SibSp", col_wrap = 2)
plot.map(sns.scatterplot, "Age", "Fare")
plot.axes[-1].legend()
plt.show()
```

## roughspace

```{python}


train_df = pd.get_dummies(train_eda, columns = ["Sex", "Embarked"])

train_df.info()
```
