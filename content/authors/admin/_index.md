I am a media professional with a natural curiosity towards media and technology. I've worked across broadcast and OTT companies since 2008 with a wide experience across Content, Business & Marketing. Currently at MXPlayer, I work on cross-functional initiatives to help boost platform growth and engagement. Almost always, content is a critical component and hence the need to evangalise the content narrative to all stakeholders. 

I am fluent in English, Hindi & Telugu. My favourite weekend activity is to switch off the laptop and listen to vinyls with my 4-year old daughter :)

### Why "The Null Hypothesis"? 
<font size = "3">
British Nobel-laureate famously said <b>“If you torture the data long enough, it will confess to anything.”</b> True words that ring loudly in any digital-first company. As someone who's cut their teeth in media research, I firmly do <b>not</b> believe that data is sacred. Rather it is consumer behaviour & insight that is sacred and we must seek it out with the help of data (big or small).

In  statistics, the null hypothesis conjecture is the first step to begin any inferential analysis. Similarly, I begin every growth project with a null hypothesis to help me understand consumer behaviour better. Particularly, this blog is my own attempt at trying a growth hack on myself. I've been passionately teaching myself new ways to analyse data and make more meaningful impact towards business. I hope to document and share my learnings through this journal.
